            Hello! My name is Scott Bui and I was born 
            and raised in Philadelphia, PA. After receiving 
            my Bachelor's in Computing and Security Technology from 
            Drexel University back in 2019, I have been 
            on a journey to find my passion in life. I have worked in IT Support,
            resold coveted and rare sneakers, and tested my luck with 
            opening Pok√©mon and Sports cards, but nothing really peaked my interest
            until late 2021, when I started to learn and get more involved 
            with Web3 and NFTs. This series of events lit a fire under my 
            butt and motivated me to learn more about web development and 
            to pursue a career in this field.
